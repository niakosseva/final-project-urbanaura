The Online Clothing Shop is a web application designed as part of the Spring Advanced Course at SoftUni. This project aims to create a user-friendly platform for customers to browse and purchase clothing items while leveraging robust backend technologies to ensure a seamless shopping experience. The application utilizes the Spring Framework, Spring Data, Hibernate, and Spring Security for backend development, and employs Thymeleaf and a Bootstrap 4 template for the front end. The database used is MySQL, and the project features RESTful API design, client-side and server-side validation and error handling, as well as internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages.

The Online Clothing Shop project is currently in progress and has not yet been deployed. Updates will be made as development continues.
